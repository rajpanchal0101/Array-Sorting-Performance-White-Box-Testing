# CS700 - Assignment 2  

*Description - This assignment consists of two sections, each focusing on different programming tasks. Section 1 involves examining the effects of array size and initial data order by noting the time taken for sorting the array, while Section 2 focuses on implementing white-box testing on a given program for validating floating-point error tolerance for certain user defined trigonometric functions. Below are the details of each section :

Section 1: Examination of the effects of array size and initial data order in sorting operation.

*Description - In Section 1, sorting operation is performed for 10 arrays of  3 particular sizes for three different orders of the array and time is noted for examining the effects of array size and initial data order on sort operation.
